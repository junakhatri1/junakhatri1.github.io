            <p style="font-size: medium"> Hi, My name is Juna. I am currently a C# student at Tech Elevator which is 14 weeks intense coding bootcamp.
                I am also a business graduate, major in Finance and I have worked in banking, retail and business industry.
               My passion for programming started to grow when I was exposed to the C Language back in high school. <br />
                Though I completed my bachelors degree in Business Administration, at the back of my head, I always wanted to learn programming.
                At this point of time, I decided to move away from my comfort zone and push my limits to learn a new Language. Before joining
                bootcamp I taught myself the concepts of Java for 5 months. The thing I love about programming is that the way it challenge you to apply
                your analytical and critical thinking skills to solve problems.
